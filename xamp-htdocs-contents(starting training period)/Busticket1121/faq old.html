			<p>Your receipt is sent to you automatically to the email address you provided when you made the booking. 
			If you did not receive your receipt, you might have provided the wrong email address. Some email servers may also classify these types of emails as spam. 
			Check that the email has not been moved to your spam folder.
			All the details you need about your booking are included on your receipt. You can always contact us and we will send you another receipt. 
			Please note that it is very important that you provide the correct email address because we use this to give you notice of any changes to the timetable or other changes to your booking.</p>

		<p class="question">Can I pay for my trip with more than one card?</p>
		
			<p>At present it is unfortunately not possible to pay with more than one card, but we are working on developing our website so that this may be possible in the future.</p>
			
		<p class="question">What payment options do I have?</p>

			<p>The different payment options are

			<li>Credit card</li>
			<li>Debit card</li>
			<li>Internet banking (Internet enabled online bank account)</li>
			<li>Wallets</li>

		<p class="question">When I am paying with a debit or credit card you ask me to enter a CVV code. What is the CVV code and where can I find it?</p>
		
			<p>The CVV code is a security code to prove that no unauthorised person is using your bank/credit card number. On VISA and Mastercard the code is in the signature area 
			on the back of your card. There are 3 characters in italics to the right of your bank/credit card number. On Eurocard the code is in the signature area on the back of 
			your card. There are 3 characters in italics to the right of the last four digits of your bank/credit card number.</p>

		<p class="question">Can I cancel my trip without cancellation protection?</p>

			<p>Yes, you can always cancel your trip. However, in order to get your money back, you must normally have to have purchased cancellation protection. 
			This is only applicable to illnesses upon proof of a valid doctor’s certificate. When you have completed your booking and pressed ‘Pay’, the booking is binding.</p>

		<p class="question">If you have informed me that I can get a refund, how does this work?</p>

			<p>If you request and have the right to a refund of your trip we will help you to obtain it. First of all, we will request a refund from the airline. 
			The airline must then approve the request in order for the refund process to begin. The refund is dependent on the provider's processing times. These can vary 
			significantly between the different airlines. Unfortunately, we cannot influence the airlines’ processing times. We will certainly do our best to ensure 
			that any refund that you are owed is made to you as soon as possible.If you paid for your trip with a card the repayment will be made to your card.</p>
